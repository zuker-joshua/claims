# claims
The claims database will allow for users to log in and create a new claim. 
Advisors will be able to sign in and edit the claim as well as its status. They will also be able to make payments.
Customers will be able to check on the claim status to see if there have been any updates made by the advisor, and update important info.

This database also contains a ‘notes’ section of the toolbar that will allow the claims advisor to add or remove information pertaining to the claim and the client. In order to access a particular claim, the advisor must use a corresponding claim number.
	
If a client requires a claim be opened, the advisor can open a new claim by going to the ‘open claim’ section of the toolbar. This will allow them to input information regarding the claim that they have at the moment, such as the make and model of the client’s vehicle, the time of the accident, etc. As time goes on this information can be updated.

When the client has been satisfied, and has been paid, the advisor may close the claim. This can be done by going to the ‘close claim’ section of the toolbar. The advisor must note the conditions in which the claim closed, such as how the client felt, and will be able to close the claim afterwards.
